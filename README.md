Welcome! This is the home of all source for the Dashboard used to display useful car information for the driver.

## Installation
PlatformIO IDE is used for building the Dashboard code.

It is recommended that you start by installing VS Code [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

PlatformIO IDE then needs to be installed (if using VS Code, search for "PlatformIO IDE" under the extensions tab 
on the left side bar)

## Building Everything/Running all tests
Once PlatformIO IDE is installed, a checkmark should appear on the bottom bar of VS Code that can be used build the code.
The right pointing arrow next to the checkmark can be used to upload to a Teensy if it is connected.
